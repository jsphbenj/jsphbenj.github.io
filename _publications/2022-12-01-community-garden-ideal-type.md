Coming into the University of Florida, Joseph was of the 2% of students in my cohort selected for the University Research Scholars Program. As a part of URSP, he took Research and Creativity in the fall of his freshman year. This course taught about the power of research by giving a comprehensive introduction to the university research process and pathways to involvement. 

In Spring 2022, Joseph began studying the impact of student transience on community garden volunteering under the guidance of Dr. Anna Peterson. This began by reading literature on the relationship between environmental values and practices and seminar discussions about the topic. This publication is the result of an ethnographic field study through observation and informal interviews, forming an ideal type of a volunteer at the community garden he participates in. The experience culminated in presenting at the UF Spring Undergraduate Research Symposium. Check out the attached poster or read the manuscript published in the 2022 volume of the University of Florida's Journal of Undergraduate Research.
