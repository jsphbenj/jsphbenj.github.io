Coming into the University of Florida, Joseph was of the 2% of students in my cohort selected for the University Research Scholars Program. As a part of URSP, he took Research and Creativity in the fall of his freshman year. This course taught about the power of research by giving a comprehensive introduction to the university research process and pathways to involvement. 

In Spring 2022, Joseph began studying the impact of student transience on community garden volunteering under the guidance of Dr. Anna Peterson. This began by reading literature on the relationship between environmental values and practices and seminar discussions about the topic. This publication is the result of an ethnographic field study through observation and informal interviews, forming an ideal type of a volunteer at the community garden he participates in. The experience culminated in presenting at the UF Spring Undergraduate Research Symposium. Check out the attached poster or read the manuscript published in the 2022 volume of the University of Florida's Journal of Undergraduate Research.

**Abstract**: A community garden (CG) is a piece of land in which community members come together to grow plants, often food. Historically, gardening programs in the United States have been a response to economic shocks, emphasizing personal responsibility by growing one’s own food to overcome economic issues. Frequently, their purposes include creating social capital and more sustainable food options, with many other ancillary benefits in health, education, value formation, and financial gain. Volunteers are necessary to achieve this. However, student volunteerism in a CG carries many challenges. College towns, including Gainesville, Florida, have a large proportion of transient college-aged residents because of the dominant role that a university holds in that city. These volunteers, being transient, may not contribute to or benefit from the community building central to a CG’s purpose. This is exacerbated by a town-gown divide, the long-standing tensions between the university and the rest of a city. This paper draws from field notes and informal interviews in a community garden located in a college town to investigate these issues. A Weberian ideal type model for student volunteers is constructed, identifying four key characteristics: consistency, willingness to learn, social competency, and self-sufficiency. This ideal type model is then compared to reality in the garden, providing insight into why universities should prepare student volunteers to maximize impact and bridge the town-gown divide.
