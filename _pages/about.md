# Hi, I'm Joey!

I love cities and seek to work at the intersection of equitable transpotation planning, spatial analysis, and environmentalism. As of August 2025, I will be pursuing my Master of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. At the University of Florida, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Sustainability and the Built Environment, specializing in Geodesign.

Currently, I am an AI Research Scholar in Dr. Chang Zhao's Ecosystem Services GeoAI lab. In the past, I've been a Student Assistant at the GeoPlan Center, DAAD RISE scholar (2023), and Brown Center Path to Purpose Community Fellow (2021-22). Outside of class and work, I love being outside! I enjoy spending my free time volunteering at Grace Grows community garden, reading in my hammock, or sketching the world around me. I minor in German and I'm passionate about language learning, which I also see as a mirror for self-reflection on my own life. 

If you want a one-page summary of my experiences, you can check out my resume. Interested in more? Check out the rest of my site or contact me!
