I love cities and seek to work at the intersection of equitable transportation planning, spatial analysis, and environmentalism. 
Currently, I am a Masters student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At the University of Florida, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Sustainability and the Built Environment, specializing in Geodesign.
As a Bachelors student, I was an AI Research Scholar in Dr. Chang Zhao's Ecosystem Services GeoAI lab. In the past, I've been a Student Assistant at the GeoPlan Center, DAAD RISE scholar (2023), and Brown Center Path to Purpose Community Fellow (2021-22). Outside of class and work, I love being outside! I enjoy spending my free time reading in my hammock or sketching the world around me.
